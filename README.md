# Cross-subject decoding of human neural data for speech Brain Computer Interfaces

Authors: Akbi Hiba, Sarrau Clémence, Vigneswaralingam Kajitha

This project consists in re-implementing a hierarchical GRU with CTC loss to decode spoken sentences from EEG recordings. Although traditional models focus on improving performance along training on datasets spanning only one participant, our ambition is to generalize this decoding to multiple datasets containing multiple participants.
